# SoloToABillion (STAB) Initiative

## The Race to the First Billion-Dollar Solo/Micro Company

Can a single entrepreneur or a tiny team build a billion-dollar company? Thanks to AI, the answer is increasingly "yes."

> "We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon... In my little group chat with tech CEO friends, there's a betting pool on when we'll see the first billion-dollar one-person company, something unimaginable without AI. Now, it will happen." ‚Äî **Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO**

> "Ten years ago, it seemed impossible for a solo company to reach a billion-dollar valuation. Today, thanks to AI, it's within reach." ‚Äî **Alexis Ohanian, Reddit Co-founder**

These bold predictions from leading tech voices mark the dawn of a new entrepreneurial era‚Äîone empowered by AI and minimal teams.

## üöÄ Our Mission

The **SoloToABillion (STAB) Initiative** is a groundbreaking registry and movement dedicated to documenting, celebrating, and accelerating the creation of the world's first billion-dollar company built by a solopreneur or micro-team (‚â§10 people).

Inspired by historic competitions like the X-Prize, STAB aims to galvanize innovators globally toward a single, audacious goal. We're not just observers‚Äîwe actively foster this historic milestone by cultivating community, accountability, and recognition for trailblazing entrepreneurs.

Our core objectives are:

1. **Documenting** the emergence and growth of billion-dollar, minimal-team ventures
2. **Celebrating** pioneers who leverage AI for unprecedented entrepreneurial scale
3. **Accelerating** progress through resources, community connections, and accountability

AI empowers individuals to automate tasks, scale operations, and generate revenue streams previously achievable only by large teams. This technological leap makes billion-dollar solo and micro-team companies not just possible but inevitable.

## What STAB Offers Entrepreneurs

STAB is the first public platform empowering entrepreneurs to:

1. **Declare** their ambition to build billion-dollar companies with teams of 10 or fewer

3. **Display** a badge linking to their STAB profile, showcasing their ambitious goal
4. **Connect** with fellow entrepreneurs pursuing similar groundbreaking achievements
5. **Share** strategies on leveraging AI, freelancers, and scalable growth methods

## üèÜ Recognition & Rewards

- **$5,000** to the first verified entrepreneur achieving a billion-dollar valuation with ‚â§10 team members.
